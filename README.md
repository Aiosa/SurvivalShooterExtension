## Legoslative ##
Author: Jiří Horák 469130

A gamemode that allows you to place lego bricks in order to survive.

Earn buttons from the enemies in order to buy lego bricks. The bricks can be placed on the ground or on the top of
other bricks. Some bricks may have special abilities:
cmd
* use flat lego 2x2 green brick to rotate objects
* use transparent yellow lego tube to add some light
* use flat 2x2 gray lego brick with one button atop with orange 1x1 cube to create gun machine!
* add red tube lego bricks to the gun machine to upgrade the range

The game is played in two modes:

**Combat mode**
Shoot enemies with your gun or smartly use lego guns to defeat the enemies. Use left mouse button or select in the right
 bottom corner of your screen a lego cube to switch to the builder mode. Use lego lights for better orientation in the
 scene, so you won't get lost in the lego cubes!

**Builder mode**   
In this mode, enemies are stuck and can't move, but so can't you.
However, your enemies can still damage either lego bricks or you if they are close enough!
The bricks are highlighted in this mode so you can easily see where you are placing lego (tip: use this feature in early
game for orientation in the dark). To select a brick to place, left mouse button drag and drop from the mode icon to the icon you
want to select (on right click a selection is shown). When you fire (e.g. left mouse button click anywhere else than the mode icon),
you return to the combat mode.

The enemies spawn more and more quickly over time, build yourself a system in that time so you are prepared!

There are two nice strategies that will allow you to survive long enough, either:
* Enclose yourself with lego bricks and one long narrow entrance corridor. Place lego guns on those corridors.
Make sure you leave a escape route for yourself; the enemies will eventually break into your hideout. The escape route has to be
very tight so that enemies cannot enter it, but you can still pass through.

* Or create a labyrinth with the lego cubes; the walls filled with escape holes (that are too tight for enemies, but not for you),
so that you can always escape and force the enemies to take the longer way around to catch you. Place lights in the labyrinth so that
you won't get lost in it.


## Health upgrade ##

Two different health kits:
* Red will heal player
* Green will increase player maximum health without healing (visually player will lost some health)

There is chance that enemy will drop one of the kit upon death.

## Monster defence ##
Author: Lukáš Sučák

Defend your base against enemies. The enemies target either you, the player
or your base (the broken robot behind you) depending on who is closer.
The base has more HP, but if either you or the base runs out of HP,
the game is over.

**Special enemies**
Mushroom - if you kill mushroom, two little shrooms spawn.
Fire Monster - if you kill it, the head explodes. It will hurt you if you stand too close.
